NAME

WWW::Scraper::DigitalArkivet - Routines to web scrape Digitalarkivet

VERSION
 0.02 - 21.09.2014

SYNOPSIS
  use WWW::Scraper::DigitalArkivet;


DESCRIPTION

Library for routines to web scrape metadata of sources from the Digital Archives of Norway also known as Digitalarkivet. None of the routines are dependable on a database, DBI related routines are split into separate library

USAGE

You can create it now by using the command shown above from this directory.

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions to install the module...

perl Makefile.PL make make test make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

REVISION HISTORY

HISTORY
 0.03 - 14.07.2015 - Module
 0.02 - 01.05.2015 - POD - Documented
 0.01 - 01.08.2014 - Created.

METHODS

Each subroutine/function (method) is documented. To avoid problems with timeout/ network errors and memory issues data should be gathered in chunks by re-runs, each run should collect a given (not too large) amount of data until there is no more to collect. Some sort of cron job needs to repeat these runs until the whole site is scraped.

Data is collected at different stages and stored in a database. Enabling re-runs to pick up were "left off".

Note: Memory usage required to hold/store data temporarily in internal data structures depend on chunk sizes. Default chunk size could be larger memory wise, but are kept smaller due to user experience on failure in communications.

•Stage 1

What are the searchable options? Look at the form, compile list for later use
    a) grab all data about inputs.
    b) store data (to a database).


•Stage 2

Scrape url's based upon options. (For each option combo) save 'Result of search'.


•Stage 3

Examine results from stage 2
    1. Search
    2. Browse
    3. Info. Details about each source
    4.


•Stage 4
    1. Try ID numbers - not published. Find info about (hidden) sources
    2. Last 100


processFormInput()

Web scrape form inputs - process inputs on form

•Input:
    $_[0] - level
    $_[1] - scrape
    $_[2] - seperator


•Output: \@data - handle to array containing data


labelFor()

Decode label attribute "for" eg ka14kt0. The label's for the attribute has a numbering system up to 3 levels. break string into 3 parts, prefix/number and make an array of each part. Pad with "null" if needed to make an array (of 3). Used later to process hierarchal structures of the inputs.

•Input: labelfor (string)


•Output: array of 3 strings


lastPage()

lastPage, of all "lastpages" scraped only last is relevant. web scrape gets too many urls, this routine fixes last page. Need only the actual page number of last page. nor url. (Thus need last page in scope)

•Input:


•Output:


s2hms()

Converts seconds into hours, minutes and seconds

•Input: seconds


•Output: hh:mm:ss


padZero()

Zero pad string eg. 003 & 02

•Input: string
    $_[0] - number (to pad)
    $_[1] - lenght (maximum)


•Output: zero padded number

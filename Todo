TODO list for Perl module WWW::Scraper::DigitalArkivet

    0. Move scripts to "module(s)"
    1. Slowly changed data/ CDC ?
    2. Drop indexes on the database before load, reinstate after load.
    3. Failsafe parameters - remove unwanted chars like " .
    4. Get hidden inputs (if needed ?? - currently doesn't seem to matter for later use).
